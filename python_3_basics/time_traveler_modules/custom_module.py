# The function should return a formatted string that incorporates the provided year, destination, and cost to create a message about the time travel experience.

def generate_time_travel_message(year, destination, cost):
    return f"Welcome to {destination} in the year {year}! Your trip has cost you ${cost}. Enjoy your stay!"
